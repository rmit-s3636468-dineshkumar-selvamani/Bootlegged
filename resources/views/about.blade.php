         <p>When you register as a seller or buyer, we’ll ask you to install a small plugin on your POS so that we can automate the listing of products that you use, how much you use and whether you should buy or sell stock based on your usage. We’ll then scan our extensive database of other shops and if we find a potential buyer or seller that matches your need, we’ll contact them with your offer.
