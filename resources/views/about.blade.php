         <p>When you register as a seller or buyer, we’ll ask you to install a small plugin on your POS so that we can automate<br> the listing of products that you use, how much you use and whether you should buy or sell stock based on your<br>usage.<br><br>We’ll then scan our extensive database of other shops and if we find a potential buyer or seller that matches<br>your need, we’ll contact them with your offer.
Once a deal has been closed, and the transaction has taken place.<br>You simply arrange suitable transport (pick-up, stock transfer, shipping)<br><br><br></p>
